# üì¶ WordleApp ‚Äì Development Workflow

This document describes the internal development workflow used in the WordleApp project, following semantic versioning, continuous integration, and best practices in code quality.

---

## üß≠ Branching Strategy

- Main branch: `master`
- Feature branches: `feature/x.y.z` or `feature/<short-description>`
- Only merge into `master` when a version is complete and stable

---

## üß™ Development per Version (`semver`)

### Example: Current version in development ‚Üí `1.1.0`

### 1. Create a feature branch

    git checkout -b feature/1.1.0

Or:

    git checkout -b feature/migrate-to-mysql

---

### 2. Follow commit message conventions

Use short, clear messages based on commit type:

| Type    | Use When...                                                                 |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat:` | You add a **new feature** visible to the user or that extends functionality. |
| `fix:`  | You fix a **bug** or correct unexpected behavior.                            |
| `refactor:` | You improve code structure **without changing behavior**.               |
| `chore:` | You make internal changes like build scripts, configs, or cleanup.         |
| `docs:` | You create or update **documentation files**.                                |
| `test:` | You add or modify **unit/integration tests**.                                |

### 3. Update the changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`)

While working on a version, keep track of what's added, changed, or removed:

    ## [v1.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

    ### ‚ú® Added
    - SecretWord entity and repository
    - Service to preload DB at startup

    ### üßº Changed
    - WordSelectorService now uses MySQL

    ### üóëÔ∏è Removed
    - File dependency (`words.txt`)

    ### üß™ Quality
    - Ready for Docker-based deployment

---

### 4. Merge, tag and release

When the version is complete:

    git checkout master
    git merge feature/1.1.0
    git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Migrate word logic to MySQL and enable Docker deployment"
    git push origin master
    git push origin v1.1.0


## üîÅ Iterating Further

Start a new version:

    git checkout -b feature/1.2.0

Repeat the same commit ‚Üí changelog ‚Üí merge ‚Üí tag ‚Üí release process.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of this workflow

- Clean and controlled releases
- Clear historical trace of features and fixes
- Easy to roll back or re-test a version
- Professional-grade CI/CD compatibility
